This lab project focuses on building a complete JavaFX desktop application for Human Resource (HR) Management. The application includes a login system and multiple modules for managing admin, employee, and salary data. It supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations connected to a MySQL database using JDBC. Users can securely log in, navigate to a dashboard, and manage records using structured pages.

Contributions:
I personally worked on:
Setting up the JavaFX project structure in Visual Studio Code.
Creating GUI pages for login, dashboard, admin, employee, and salary management.
Implementing MySQL database structure and creating tables for admin, employee, and salary.
Writing database connection code and configuring JDBC drivers.
Coding INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT logic using PreparedStatement.
I used AI-generated suggestions to:
Design intuitive JavaFX layouts using VBox, HBox, and GridPane
Implement event-driven behavior using JavaFX event handlers
Set up JDBC URL and error handling for database connectivity
Plan out DAO (Data Access Object) patterns and model-to-database interaction
Structure the overall flow between login, dashboard, and CRUD scenes

In Section L, I attempted to implement JUnit test cases to verify salary calculations based on base salary, bonus, and deductions. I created a SalaryCalculator class to compute yearly salary values and a SalaryCalculatorTest class to test various salary scenarios. Although I successfully wrote the methods and test cases, I faced challenges with setting up the test environment in Visual Studio Code.
